# DHT Pastry Protocol Model, Specification and Verification

This repository exposes the result of a project done in the scope of the [_Specification and Modelling_](wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Education/MFES1819/EM) course at University of Minho.

The objective is to model, specify and verify, using [Alloy Analyzer](https://alloytools.org/), part of the DHT Pastry Protocol. This has already been [done](http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/forte/forte2011/LuMW11.pdf), using TLA+, but this is an attempt to do so in Alloy.

## Project overview

The project consists of 2 files. One file for the model and its specification/verification and other for the visualizer theme.
